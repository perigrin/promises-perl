=head1 DESCRIPTION

Promise objects are typically not created by hand, they
are typically returned from the C<promise> method of
a L<Promises::Deferred> instance. It is best to think
of a L<Promises::Promise> instance as a handle for
L<Promises::Deferred> instances.

Most of the documentation here points back to the
documentation in the L<Promises::Deferred> module.

Additionally the L<Promises> module contains a long
explanation of how this module, and all it's components
are meant to work together.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item C<new( $deferred )>

The constructor only takes one parameter and that is an
instance of L<Promises::Deferred> that you want this
object to proxy.

=item C<then( $callback, $error )>

This calls C<then> on the proxied L<Promises::Deferred> instance.

=item C<status>

This calls C<status> on the proxied L<Promises::Deferred> instance.

=item C<result>

This calls C<result> on the proxied L<Promises::Deferred> instance.

=item C<is_unfulfilled>

This calls C<is_unfulfilled> on the proxied L<Promises::Deferred> instance.

=item C<is_fulfilled>

This calls C<is_fulfilled> on the proxied L<Promises::Deferred> instance.

=item C<is_failed>

This calls C<is_failed> on the proxied L<Promises::Deferred> instance.

=item C<is_in_progress>

This calls C<is_in_progress> on the proxied L<Promises::Deferred> instance.

=item C<is_resolving>

This calls C<is_resolving> on the proxied L<Promises::Deferred> instance.

=item C<is_rejecting>

This calls C<is_rejecting> on the proxied L<Promises::Deferred> instance.

=item C<is_resolved>

This calls C<is_resolved> on the proxied L<Promises::Deferred> instance.

=item C<is_rejected>

This calls C<is_rejected> on the proxied L<Promises::Deferred> instance.
